摘要:
We propose a Coefficient-to-Basis Network (C2BNet), a novel framework for
solving inverse problems within the operator learning paradigm. C2BNet
efficiently adapts to different discretizations through fine-tuning, using a
pre-trained model to significantly reduce computational cost while maintaining
high accuracy. Unlike traditional approaches that require retraining from
scratch for new discretizations, our method enables seamless adaptation without
sacrificing predictive performance. Furthermore, we establish theoretical
approximation and generalization error bounds for C2BNet by exploiting
low-dimensional structures in the underlying datasets. Our analysis
demonstrates that C2BNet adapts to low-dimensional structures without relying
on explicit encoding mechanisms, highlighting its robustness and efficiency. To
validate our theoretical findings, we conducted extensive numerical experiments
that showcase the superior performance of C2BNet on several inverse problems.
The results confirm that C2BNet effectively balances computational efficiency
and accuracy, making it a promising tool to solve inverse problems in
scientific computing and engineering applications.
