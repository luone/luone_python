摘要:
Data heterogeneity is one of the major challenges in federated learning (FL),
which results in substantial client variance and slow convergence. In this
study, we propose a novel solution: decomposing a convolutional filter in FL
into a linear combination of filter subspace elements, i.e., filter atoms. This
simple technique transforms global filter aggregation in FL into aggregating
filter atoms and their atom coefficients. The key advantage here involves
mathematically generating numerous cross-terms by expanding the product of two
weighted sums from filter atom and atom coefficient. These cross-terms
effectively emulate many additional latent clients, significantly reducing
model variance, which is validated by our theoretical analysis and empirical
observation. Furthermore, our method permits different training schemes for
filter atoms and atom coefficients for highly adaptive model personalization
and communication efficiency. Empirical results on benchmark datasets
demonstrate that our filter decomposition technique substantially improves the
accuracy of FL methods, confirming its efficacy in addressing data
heterogeneity.
