摘要:
Curse of Dimensionality is an unavoidable challenge in statistical
probability models, yet diffusion models seem to overcome this limitation,
achieving impressive results in high-dimensional data generation. Diffusion
models assume that they can learn the statistical properties of the underlying
probability distribution, enabling sampling from this distribution to generate
realistic samples. But is this really how they work? To address this question,
this paper conducts a detailed analysis of the objective function and inference
methods of diffusion models, leading to several important conclusions that help
answer the above question: 1) In high-dimensional sparse scenarios, the target
of the objective function fitting degrades from a weighted sum of multiple
samples to a single sample. 2) The mainstream inference methods can all be
represented within a simple unified framework, without requiring statistical
concepts such as Markov chains and SDEs. 3) Guided by this simple framework,
more efficient inference methods can be discovered.
