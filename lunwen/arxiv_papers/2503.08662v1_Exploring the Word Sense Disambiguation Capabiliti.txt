摘要:
Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD) is a historical task in computational
linguistics that has received much attention over the years. However, with the
advent of Large Language Models (LLMs), interest in this task (in its classical
definition) has decreased. In this study, we evaluate the performance of
various LLMs on the WSD task. We extend a previous benchmark (XL-WSD) to
re-design two subtasks suitable for LLM: 1) given a word in a sentence, the LLM
must generate the correct definition; 2) given a word in a sentence and a set
of predefined meanings, the LLM must select the correct one. The extended
benchmark is built using the XL-WSD and BabelNet. The results indicate that
LLMs perform well in zero-shot learning but cannot surpass current
state-of-the-art methods. However, a fine-tuned model with a medium number of
parameters outperforms all other models, including the state-of-the-art.
